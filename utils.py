A story synopsis is a brief summary or overview of the main events, characters, and themes of a story. It serves as an outline of the plot, providing an overview without delving into finer details, minute plot points, or character development. A good synopsis will give the reader or listener a clear idea of the story's premise, main events, and resolution without giving away every twist and turn.

Writers and screenwriters often use synopses when pitching their stories to agents, publishers, or producers. These professionals might read dozens of story ideas in a day, so the synopsis must be concise, clear, and engaging, giving them a reason to want to see more.

For instance, a brief synopsis of "The Little Red Riding Hood" might be:

"A young girl named Little Red Riding Hood sets off through the woods to visit her sick grandmother. Along the way, she meets a cunning wolf who tricks her and reaches her grandmother's house first. Disguised as the grandmother, the wolf tries to eat Red Riding Hood but is ultimately defeated by a passing huntsman."

This synopsis provides an understanding of the story without going into all the details of the interactions, dialogues, and small events.
